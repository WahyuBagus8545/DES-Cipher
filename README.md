# DES-Cipher
**What is DES?** 

It is an encryption/decryption algrotihm or technique used to encrypt and decrypt a block of data. You can read more about the algorithm [here](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~kant/teaching/hess/krypto-ws2006/des.htm) and also [here](http://www.umsl.edu/~siegelj/information_theory/projects/des.netau.net/Dataencryptionalgorithm.html).


**Features of DES:**

1. It used to encrypt messgae (plain text) of length 64-bits and produce the cipher text (unreadable message) of length 64-bit too.<br>
2. It used symmetric key, means that the same key will be used for both encryption & decryption. <br>
3. It gets the power from using the F function which is a function involves several consecutive steps.<br>
4. The algorithm involves 16-rounds and in each round there is 48-bit key(i) used for both encryption & decryption.
